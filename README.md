# CrAM

We provide our code and data in this repository.

All of our results can be found in the `results`, `results_real`, and `results1` folders. The `results` folder contains experimental results without misinformation, `results_real` includes results under GPT setting, and `results1` contains results under ideal setting.

Some example code is in `run.sh`.

A more complete code repository will be released after the review process is completed.
